# ISS Tracking Project

Hi students! How is the demo going?

In this project I created an ETL app and a front-end Python Flask app to display the location of the International Space Station in real-time. The ETL app calls four APIs every minute to get the location of the International Space Station, the weather at that location, the country information at that location, and finally a random number fact. The Flask app displays a map using Leaflet.js with a maker for each datapoint. The Flask app and Postgres database are deployed using Heroku.
